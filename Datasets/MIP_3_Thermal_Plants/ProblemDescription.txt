You are tasked with scheduling the power output of K electric power thermal units over the timespan of T periods. There is a constant startup cost for each power unit that is applied if the power plant is turned on. In addition, there is a constant shutdown cost for each power unit that is applied if the power plant is turned off. There is also a fixed and variable cost applied when the powerplant is running for each power unit where the fixed cost is constant and the variable cost is propotioal to the output of a power plant. There are lower and upper bounds for the output power for each unit. Next, there are maximum power increments and decremnts for each power plant that limit how much the ouput can change from one time period to the next. There is a total power demand that needs to be fullfiled the power units. Finally, for security reasons the total available power out should always be higher than the used power output by a given amount.
