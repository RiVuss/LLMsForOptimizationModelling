The PRODA, S.A. industrial products firm has to face the problem of scheduling
the weekly production of its three products (P1, P2 and P3). These products are
sold to large industrial firms and PRODA, S.A. wishes to supply its products in
quantities that are more profitable for it.

Each product entails three operations contributing to the costs: smelting; mechanisation; assembly and
packaging. The smelting operations for products P1 and P2 could be subcontracted, but the smelting operation for product P3 requires special equipment, thus
preventing the use of subcontracts. PRODA also want to know, how much they should subcontract.

For product P1 the direct unit costs of all possible operations are:
- smelting at PRODA: 0.30$
- subcontracted smelting: 0.50$
- mechanisation: 0.20$
- Assembly and packaging: 0.3$
The unit sales price is 1.50$.

For product P2 the direct unit costs of all possible operations are:
- smelting at PRODA: 0.50$
- subcontracted smelting: 0.60$
- mechanisation: 0.10$
- Assembly and packaging: 0.20$
The unit sales price is 1.80$.

For product P3 the direct unit costs of all possible operations are:
- smelting at PRODA: 0.40$
- mechanisation: 0.27$
- Assembly and packaging: 0.20$
The unit sales price is 1.97$.

Each unit of product P1 requires 6 min of smelting time (if performed at PRODA, S.A.), 6 min of mechanisation time and 3 min of assembly and packaging time, respectively. For product P2, the times are 10, 3 and 2 min, respectively. One unit of product P3 needs 8 min of smelting time, 8 min of mechanisation and 2 min for assembly and packaging. PRODA, S.A. has weekly capacities of 8,000 min of smelting time, 12,000 min of mechanisation time and 10,000 min of assembly and packaging time.
The objective is to maximize weekly profits.
