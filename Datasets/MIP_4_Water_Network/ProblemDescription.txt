You are task with maximizing the water flow in a network of pipes over 10 time steps. The water enters the system at point A and exits the system at point G. Hence, you need to maximize the amount of water that flows to point G. The water enters point A according to the function f(t) = -t^3+4t^2-t+4, where t is the time step. There are serveral points that are connected through pipes. Each pipe has a fixed capacity. Each point has to possibility to release water out of the system in case the outgoing pipes are full. There are 8 available pipes in total but only 6 of them can be activated. Deactivated pipes can not be used to transport water. The activation status of a pipe is set before any water arrives at point A and does not change. Finally, water can not be stored at the connection points which means that any water coming in at time t needs to be flowing out at time t + 1.
