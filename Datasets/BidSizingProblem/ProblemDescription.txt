A buyer needs to acquire 239,600,480 units of a product and is considering bids from five suppliers, labeled A through E, each of whom can only supply a portion of the total required amount. Each vendor has proposed different pricing structures, incorporating both setup fees and variable unit costs that change based on the quantity ordered. The buyer's objective is to allocate the order among these suppliers to minimize overall costs, accounting for both setup and unit costs. Vendor A offers a set up cost of $3855.34 and a unit cost of $61.150 per thousand of units. Vendor A can supply up to 33 million units.

If purchasing between 70,000,001-100,000,000 units from vendor B, the set up cost increases to $269304.84 and the unit cost sinks to $66.049 per thousand units. If purchasing between 100,000,001-150,000,000 units from vendor B, the unit cost per thousand units further decreases to $64.099, but the set up cost increases to $464304.84.
