You are in charge of the supply purchasing of a company that produces two kinds of drugs. 
The drugs contain a specific active agent, which is extracted from two different kinds of raw materials that should be purchased on the market. 

The goal is to maximize the total profit obtained from producing the drugs, which means minimizing purchasing costs for buying the raw materials and minimizing operational costs for producing the drugs while maximizing sales. 

You are given a budget for purchasing raw materials and operating the production process of the drugs which cannot be exceeded. 
Additionally, you need to keep the capacity constraints for the production of the drugs in mind as there is only a limited amount of manpower as well as equipment hours available. 
Your company can also only store a limited amount of raw materials. 
Most importantly, the amount of active ingredient extracted from the raw materials you purchase needs to satisfy the required amount of active ingredient in the drugs your company produces. 
Importantly, your experience with the production of the drugs has shown the the amount of active ingredient your process extracts from the two raw materials can vary by up to 0.5% and 2%, respectively. 
During purchasing, you need to make sure that no matter how much the amount of active ingredient varies, the required amount for the drug production is always met.
