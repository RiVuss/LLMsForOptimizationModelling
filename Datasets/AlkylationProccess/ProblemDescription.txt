We are looking at an alkylation process which will include the following factors: olefin feed (barrels per day), isobutane recycle (barrels per day), acid addition rate (thousands of pounds per day), alkylate yield (barrels per day), isobutane makeup (barrels per day), acid strength (weight per cent), motor octane number, external isobutane-to-olefin ratio, acid dilution factor and F-4 performance number. We want to maximize the daily profit of this alkylation process. The profit is defined as the revenue generated from the alkylate yield, adjusted by the motor octane number, minus the operational costs, which include olefin feed, isobutane recycle, acid addition rate, and isobutane makeup. Relationships for alkylate yield, motor octane number, acid dilution factor, and F-4 performance number are given by regression formulas. Alkylate yield is a function of olefin feed and external isobutane-to-olefine yield. The motor octane number is derived from the external isobutane-to-olefin ratio and the acid strength. The acid dilution factor is calculated based on the F-4 performance number. Lastly, the F-4 performance number depends on the motor octane number. Each variable is bounded by a lower and upper percentage deviation from estimated values. There are some additional constraints imposed by the nature of the chemical process. The external isobutane-to-olefin ratio needs to equal the ratio of isobutane recycle plus isobutane makeup to olefin feed. The acid strength needs to equal the ratio of 98000 times acid addition rate to acid addition rate multiplied by acid dilution factor in addition to 1000 times acid factor. Lastly, 1.22 alkylate yield needs to be equal to the combined olefin feed and isobutane makeup.
