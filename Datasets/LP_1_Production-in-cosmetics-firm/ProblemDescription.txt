A firm from Milan sells chemical products for professional cosmetics. It is planning the production of three products, GCA, GCB and GCC, for a given period of
time by mixing two different components: C1 and C2. All the end products must
contain at least one of the two components, and not necessarily both.

For the next planning period, 10,000 l of C1 and 15,000 l of C2 are available.
The production of GCA, GCB and GCC must be scheduled to at least cover the
minimum demand level of 6,000, 7,000 and 9,000 l, respectively. It is assumed
that when chemical components are mixed, there is no loss or gain in volume.

Each chemical component, C1 and C2, has a proportional critical element, 0.4
and 0.2, respectively. That is to say, each litre of C1 contains 0.4 l of the critical
element. To obtain GCA, the mixture must proportionally contain at least a 0.3
fraction of the critical element. Another requirement is that the quantity of the
critical element is seen in GCB, an 0.3 fraction at the most.
Furthermore, the minimum ratio of C1 with C2 in product GCC must be 0.3.

The profit expected for the sale of each litre of GCA, GCB and GCC is $120, $135
and $155, respectively.
