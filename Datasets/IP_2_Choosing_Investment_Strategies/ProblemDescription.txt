Your goal is to invest in several of 10 possible investment strategies in the most optimal way. The historic returns of those strategies are stored in the file "investments_data.csv". Each column represents one strategy and the rows are the past investment outcomes. There is no index and the values are separated by a ;.

The costs for investing in a given investment is stored in a vector A, which has one value for each strategy in order.  
The values are: [80, 340, 410, 50, 180, 221, 15, 348, 191, 225]

You can only invest once into an investment. 

Unfortunately due to other costs and inflation, your available budget at this time is uncertain. There are four possible budget scenarios with different probabilities: scenario 1 with 1000 euros and probability of 0.55, scenario 2  with 1100 euros and probability of 0.4, scenario 3 with 900 euros and probability of 0.04, scenario 4 with 1200 euros and probability of 0.01. 
The tolerable probability of exceeding the budget is 0.4.

Please formulate a mean-variance mathematical model for this optimization problem, considering the past performance of investment strategies and the uncertain budget. You can take 2 as the risk parameter r.
