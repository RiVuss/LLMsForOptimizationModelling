Your goal is to invest in several of 10 possible investment strategies in the most optimal way.There are different costs of investing into each of the investment options. .
Unfortunately due to other costs and inflation, your available budget at this time is uncertain. There are four possible budget scenarios with different probabilities: scenario 1 with 1000 euros and probability of 0.55, scenario 2  with 1100 euros and probability of 0.4, scenario 3 with 900 euros and probability of 0.04, scenario 4 with 1200 euros and probability of 0.01. You can only invest once into an investment. Please formulate a mean-variance mathematical model for this optimization problem with chance constraints in order to obtain an optimal investment strategy.
