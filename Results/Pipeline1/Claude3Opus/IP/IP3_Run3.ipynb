            "Explanation:\n",
            "- We define the model using `ConcreteModel()` from Pyomo.\n",
            "- The parameters `N`, `M`, `w`, and `C` are defined using `Param()`. Here, we use sample data:\n",
            "  - `N = 10` represents the total number of items.\n",
            "  - `M = 5` represents the maximum number of boxes.\n",
            "  - `w` is a dictionary that represents the weight of each item.\n",
            "  - `C = 10` represents the capacity of each box.\n",
            "- The decision variables `x` and `y` are defined using `Var()` with binary domains.\n",
            "- The objective function is defined using `Objective()`, which minimizes the sum of `y[j]` (number of boxes used).\n",
            "- The constraints are defined using `Constraint()`:\n",
            "  - `item_packing` ensures that each item is packed into exactly one box.\n",
            "  - `capacity` ensures that the total weight of items packed into each box does not exceed the box capacity.\n",
            "  - `box_usage` ensures that items can only be packed into boxes that are being used.\n",
            "- The model is solved using the `glpk` solver (you may need to install it separately).\n",
            "- Finally, the results are printed, including the number of boxes used and the packing arrangement.\n",
            "\n",
            "Note: The sample data used in this code is for demonstration purposes only. You can modify the parameters and sample data according to your specific problem instance.\n"
