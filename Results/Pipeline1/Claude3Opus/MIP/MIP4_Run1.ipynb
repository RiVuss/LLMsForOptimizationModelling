            " You are task with maximizing the water flow in a network of pipes over 10 time steps. The water enters the system at point A and exits the system at point G. Hence, you need to maximize the amount of water that flows to point G. The water enters point A according to the function f(t) = max(-4/30t^3+t^2-0.234t+3, 0), where t is the time step. There are serveral points that are connected through pipes. Each pipe has a fixed capacity. Each point has to possibility to release water out of the system in case the outgoing pipes are full. There are 12 available pipes in total but only 10 of them can be activated. Deactivated pipes can not be used to transport water. The activation status of a pipe is set before any water arrives at point A and does not change. Finally, water can not be stored at the connection points which means that any water coming in at time t needs to be flowing out at time t + 1.\n",
