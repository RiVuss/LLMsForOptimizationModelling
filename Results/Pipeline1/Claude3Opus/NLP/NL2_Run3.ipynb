Your goal is to maximize the quality of the product in the end, which is measured by the difference between the Napierian logarithm of the product of the litres used of each component and the cube root of the summation of the first component litres as well as double the second component litres. It is required that the squared difference between the litres employed of each component and the mean litres utilised of both components is below ten. This is necessary for the obtained set to be stable. Furthermore, the mixture tank available to you can only fit 80 l. Please formulate a mathematical optimization model for this problem. \n",

            "\n",
            "1. We import the necessary components from the `pyomo.environ` module.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. We create a concrete model using `ConcreteModel()`.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. We define the parameter `C` to represent the maximum capacity of the mixture tank, which is set to 80 liters.\n",
            "\n",
            "4. We define the decision variables `x1` and `x2` to represent the liters of the first and second liquid components, respectively. Both variables are constrained to be non-negative using `domain=NonNegativeReals`.\n",
            "\n",
            "5. We define the objective function `quality_rule` using the mathematical expression provided. The objective is to maximize the quality.\n",
            "\n",
            "6. We define the stability constraint `stability_rule` using the given inequality. It ensures that the squared difference between the liters used of each component and the mean liters used of both components is less than or equal to 10.\n",
            "\n",
            "7. We define the capacity constraint `capacity_rule` to ensure that the sum of the liters used of both components does not exceed the maximum capacity of the mixture tank.\n",
            "\n",
            "8. We create an instance of the solver using `SolverFactory('ipopt')`. You can choose a different solver if desired.\n",
            "\n",
            "9. We solve the optimization problem using `solver.solve(model)`.\n",
            "\n",
            "10. Finally, we print the optimal solution, including the values of `x1`, `x2`, and the quality objective.\n",
            "\n",
            "Note: This code assumes that you have Pyomo and a suitable solver (such as IPOPT) installed in your Python environment. Make sure to install the required dependencies before running the code.\n"
