            " A firm that packs refreshments and beers, situated in the province of Valencia (Spain) employs the same syrup to produce its 1.5 l COLI and PEPSA products on its S1 production line. Once processed, each hectolitre of syrup produces 40 units of the 1.5 l COLI product and 20 units of the 1.5 l PEPSA product. If X1 units of the 1.5 l COLI product and X2 units of the 1.5 l PEPSA product are produced, the firm estimates that the daily income obtained in dollars would be given by the following function:\n",

The firm works 5 days a week in 8h shifts. Given its weekly target coverage, the firm is committed to produce at least half the amount of PEPSA than COLI. Although priority orders tend to amend its production planning, the firm wishes to have a basic product planning that optimises its daily profits. \n",
