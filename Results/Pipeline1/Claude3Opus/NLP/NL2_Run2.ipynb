Your goal is to maximize the quality of the product in the end, which is measured by the difference between the Napierian logarithm of the product of the litres used of each component and the cube root of the summation of the first component litres as well as double the second component litres. It is required that the squared difference between the litres employed of each component and the mean litres utilised of both components is below ten. This is necessary for the obtained set to be stable. Furthermore, the mixture tank available to you can only fit 80 l. Please formulate a mathematical optimization model for this problem. \n",
