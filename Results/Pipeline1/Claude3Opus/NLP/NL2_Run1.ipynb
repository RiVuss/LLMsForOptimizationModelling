It is required that the squared difference between the litres employed of each component and the mean litres utilised of both components is below ten. This is necessary for the obtained set to be stable. Furthermore, the mixture tank available to you can only fit 80 l. Please formulate a mathematical optimization model for this problem. \n",

            "\n",
            "2. We create a concrete Pyomo model using `ConcreteModel()`.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. We define the decision variables `x1` and `x2` as non-negative real numbers using `Var(domain=NonNegativeReals)`.\n",
            "\n",
            "4. We define the objective function using `Objective()`. The objective function is to maximize the quality of the product, which is expressed as `log(model.x1 * model.x2) - (model.x1 + 2 * model.x2)**(1/3)`. We use `log()` for the natural logarithm (Napierian logarithm) and `**(1/3)` for the cube root.\n",
            "\n",
            "5. We define the constraints using `Constraint()`:\n",
            "   - The stability constraint is expressed as `(model.x1 - (model.x1 + model.x2) / 2)**2 + (model.x2 - (model.x1 + model.x2) / 2)**2 <= 10`.\n",
            "   - The mixture tank capacity constraint is expressed as `model.x1 + model.x2 <= 80`.\n",
            "\n",
            "6. We create an instance of the IPOPT solver using `SolverFactory('ipopt')` and solve the optimization problem using `solver.solve(model)`.\n",
            "\n",
            "7. Finally, we print the optimal solution values for `x1`, `x2`, and the objective value.\n",
            "\n",
            "Note that no sample data is used in this code as all the necessary parameters are directly defined within the code itself. The model uses the maximum capacity of the mixture tank as 80 litres, as given in the problem statement.\n"
