      "**Explanation:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Import Pyomo library:** Imports the necessary Pyomo library for creating optimization models.\n",
      "2. **Create a concrete model:** Defines a concrete Pyomo model instance.\n",
      "3. **Sample Data:**  Provides sample data for sets, parameters, and indices. Replace this with your actual data.\n",
      "4. **Define sets:** Defines sets for customers (I) and potential facility locations (J).\n",
      "5. **Define parameters:** Defines parameters including fixed activation costs, transportation costs, customer demands, and facility capacities.\n",
      "6. **Define decision variables:** \n",
      "    *   `model.x`:  Fraction of customer demand served by each facility (continuous variable between 0 and 1).\n",
      "    *   `model.y`: Binary variable indicating whether a facility is opened (1) or not (0). \n",
      "7. **Define objective function:** Defines the objective function to minimize the total cost, including fixed activation costs and transportation costs.\n",
      "8. **Define constraints:** \n",
      "    *   **Demand Satisfaction:** Ensures that each customer's demand is fully met by summing the fractions served by all facilities.\n",
      "    *   **Capacity Restriction:** Ensures that the total demand served by a facility does not exceed its capacity, considering whether it's open or closed.\n",
      "    *   **Facility Usage:** Ensures a customer can only be served by an open facility. \n",
      "\n",
      "**To solve the model:**\n",
      "\n",
      "```python\n",
      "# Choose a solver (e.g., CBC, Gurobi, CPLEX)\n",
      "solver = SolverFactory('cbc')  # Replace with your preferred solver\n",
      "\n",
      "# Solve the model\n",
      "results = solver.solve(model)\n",
      "\n",
      "# Print results\n",
      "print(results)\n",
      "\n",
      "# Access specific results\n",
      "for j in model.J:\n",
      "    if model.y[j].value > 0.5:  # Check if facility j is open\n",
      "        print(f\"Facility at location {j} is open\")\n",
      "        for i in model.I:\n",
      "            print(f\"  Customer {i} demand served: {model.x[i, j].value:.2f}\")\n",

      "**Important Notes:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   Replace the sample data with your actual data.\n",
      "*   Choose an appropriate solver based on your problem size and license availability.\n",
      "*   Install the chosen solver and ensure it is accessible by Pyomo.\n",
