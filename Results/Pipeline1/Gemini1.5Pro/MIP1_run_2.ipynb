      "3. **Sample Data:**  Provides sample data for sets, parameters, and indices. Replace this with your actual data.\n",
      "4. **Define sets:** Defines sets for customers (I) and potential facility locations (J).\n",
      "5. **Define parameters:** Defines parameters including fixed activation costs, transportation costs, customer demands, and facility capacities.\n",
      "6. **Define decision variables:** \n",
      "    *   `model.x`:  Fraction of customer demand served by each facility (continuous variable between 0 and 1).\n",
      "    *   `model.y`: Binary variable indicating whether a facility is opened (1) or not (0). \n",
      "7. **Define objective function:** Defines the objective function to minimize the total cost, including fixed activation costs and transportation costs.\n",
      "8. **Define constraints:** \n",
      "    *   **Demand Satisfaction:** Ensures that each customer's demand is fully met by summing the fractions served by all facilities.\n",
      "    *   **Capacity Restriction:** Ensures that the total demand served by a facility does not exceed its capacity, considering whether it's open or closed.\n",
      "    *   **Facility Usage:** Ensures a customer can only be served by an open facility. \n",
