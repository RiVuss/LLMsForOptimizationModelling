       "**Explanation:**\n",
       "\n",
       "1. **Sample Data:** The code defines sample data for facilities, customers, costs, demand, and capacity. Make sure to replace these with your actual data.\n",
       "2. **Model:** A Pyomo `ConcreteModel` is created to represent the optimization problem.\n",
       "3. **Sets and Parameters:** Sets for facilities and customers, and parameters for costs, demand, and capacity are defined using `pyo.Set` and `pyo.Param`.\n",
       "4. **Variables:** Decision variables `x` and `y` are defined using `pyo.Var`.\n",
       "   -  `model.x` represents the amount of demand served.\n",
       "   -  `model.y` represents whether a facility is open (1) or not (0).\n",
       "5. **Objective Function:** The objective is to minimize total cost, which includes facility activation costs and transportation costs. This is defined using `pyo.Objective`.\n",
       "6. **Constraints:** The constraints are:\n",
       "   -  `demand_constraint`: Ensures all customer demand is met.\n",
       "   -  `capacity_constraint`: Ensures that no facility exceeds its capacity.\n",
       "   -  `activation_constraint`: Ensures customers are only served by open facilities.\n",
       "7. **Solving:** A solver (in this case, 'glpk') is used to solve the model.\n",
       "8. **Printing Results:** The code prints the solver status, objective value, open facilities, and the customer allocation to each open facility.\n",
       "\n",
       "Remember to install the necessary packages (Pyomo and a solver like GLPK) before running this code. \n"

      "**Explanation:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Sample Data:** The code defines sample data for facilities, customers, costs, demand, and capacity. Make sure to replace these with your actual data.\n",
      "2. **Model:** A Pyomo `ConcreteModel` is created to represent the optimization problem.\n",
      "3. **Sets and Parameters:** Sets for facilities and customers, and parameters for costs, demand, and capacity are defined using `pyo.Set` and `pyo.Param`.\n",
      "4. **Variables:** Decision variables `x` and `y` are defined using `pyo.Var`.\n",
      "   -  `model.x` represents the amount of demand served.\n",
      "   -  `model.y` represents whether a facility is open (1) or not (0).\n",
      "5. **Objective Function:** The objective is to minimize total cost, which includes facility activation costs and transportation costs. This is defined using `pyo.Objective`.\n",
      "6. **Constraints:** The constraints are:\n",
      "   -  `demand_constraint`: Ensures all customer demand is met.\n",
      "   -  `capacity_constraint`: Ensures that no facility exceeds its capacity.\n",
      "   -  `activation_constraint`: Ensures customers are only served by open facilities.\n",
      "7. **Solving:** A solver (in this case, 'glpk') is used to solve the model.\n",
      "8. **Printing Results:** The code prints the solver status, objective value, open facilities, and the customer allocation to each open facility.\n",
      "\n",
      "Remember to install the necessary packages (Pyomo and a solver like GLPK) before running this code. \n",
