    "problem = '''A firm that packs refreshments and beers, situated in the province of Valencia (Spain) employs the same syrup to produce its 1.5 l COLI and PEPSA products on its S1 production line. Once processed, each hectolitre of syrup produces 40 units of the 1.5 l COLI product and 20 units of the 1.5 l PEPSA product. If X1 units of the 1.5 l COLI product and X2 units of the 1.5 l PEPSA product are produced, the firm estimates that the daily income obtained in dollars would be given by the following function:\n",
