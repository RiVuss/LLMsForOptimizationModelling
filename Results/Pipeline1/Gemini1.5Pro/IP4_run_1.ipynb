       "8. **Solve:**  We create a solver object (here using the free CBC solver) and use it to solve the model.\n",
       "9. **Print Results:** The code prints the solver's status and the optimal values for each decision variable. \n",

      "**Explanation:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Import pyomo:** This line imports the Pyomo library for optimization modeling.\n",
      "2. **Sample Data:**  I've provided sample data for the parameters. You should replace this with your shop's actual data.\n",
      "3. **Model:** This creates a ConcreteModel object, which is a Pyomo model instance.\n",
      "4. **Sets:** We define a set `E` to represent the types of employees (Full-Time, Part-Time). This is currently unused but could be useful for extending the model, for example, adding different types of employees.\n",
      "5. **Decision Variables:** We define the decision variables using `pyo.Var()`.  The `domain=pyo.NonNegativeReals` ensures that these variables can only take non-negative values.\n",
      "6. **Objective Function:** The `objective_rule` function defines the objective function as described in your problem. It calculates the weighted sum of deviations from the targets.\n",
      "7. **Constraints:**  This example includes a commented-out constraint to demonstrate how you can add constraints. You should replace this with constraints relevant to your shop's specific rules and limitations.\n",
      "8. **Solve:**  We create a solver object (here using the free CBC solver) and use it to solve the model.\n",
      "9. **Print Results:** The code prints the solver's status and the optimal values for each decision variable. \n",
      "\n",
      "**Remember:** \n",
      "\n",
      "* **Adjust Priority Factors:** Change the values of `P1`, `P2`, `P3`, and `P4` to reflect the priorities for your shop.\n",
      "* **Add Constraints:** Incorporate constraints relevant to your shop, such as limits on working hours, minimum sales targets, or relationships between variables. \n",
      "* **Data Input:**  Replace the sample data with your actual data for more meaningful results. \n",
