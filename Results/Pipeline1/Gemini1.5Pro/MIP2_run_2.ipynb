    "problem = '''You are the production planner in a food and beverage production fascility. You are tasked with planning production for the next 12 time periods with the goal of maximizing profit. The production fascility is able to produce two types of food and three types of beverage. The food is produced in whole units, while the beverage can be produced in any fraction of a liter. For each product that is produced at period t, a fixed cost and variable cost incurred. Each product can also be stored which is also associated with a variable cost per product stored. There is also a maximum demand for each product and time period which means that a specific product will not be sold anymore if the demand is met for that time period. Please note, that the demand does not have to be met. The revenue per product and time also differs. The cost for production and storage, the demand and revenue are all provided as in sepearte csv files named \"fixed_cost_production.csv\", \"variable_cost_production.csv\", \"variable_cost_storage.csv\", \"demand.csv\" and \"revenue.csv\" where all files follow the structre of the columns representing time and rows representing product. Finally, there is a constant storage capacity and production capacity for each product that resets each time period. The storage capacity is 580 units of food 1, 687 units of food 2, 599L of beverage one, 788 Liters of beverage 2 and 294L of beverage 3. The production capacity is 1080 units of food 1, 908 units of food 2, 408L of beverage one, 1000L of beverage 2 and 403L of beverage 3. '''"

       "**Explanation:**\n",
       "\n",
       "1.  **Import Pyomo:**  `import pyomo.environ as pyo`\n",
       "2.  **Sample Data:** The code starts by defining sample data for the parameters. **Remember to replace this sample data with the actual data from your CSV files.**\n",
       "3.  **Create a Model:** A `ConcreteModel` is created to represent the optimization problem.\n",
       "4.  **Define Sets:** Sets for time periods (T), food products (F), and beverage products (B) are created using `pyo.Set`.\n",
       "5.  **Define Parameters:** The parameters from the problem are defined using `pyo.Param` and initialized with the sample data.\n",
       "6.  **Define Decision Variables:** Decision variables are defined using `pyo.Var` and are restricted to be non-negative using `domain=pyo.NonNegativeReals`.\n",
       "7.  **Define Objective Function:** The objective function, which is to maximize profit, is defined using `pyo.Objective`.\n",
       "8.  **Define Constraints:**  Each constraint from the mathematical model is implemented using `pyo.Constraint`.\n",
       "9.  **Solve the Model:** A solver ('cbc' in this case) is selected using `pyo.SolverFactory` and then used to solve the model.\n",
       "10. **Print Results:** The optimal profit and values of decision variables can be printed using the `print()` function and accessing the variable values using `.get_values()`.\n",
       "\n",
       "**To Use Your Data:**\n",
       "\n",
       "1.  **Install Pyomo:**  You can install Pyomo using `pip install pyomo`.\n",
       "2.  **Import Data from CSV:** You can use libraries like `pandas` to import data from your CSV files.\n",
       "3.  **Replace Sample Data:** Replace the sample data in the code with the data you imported from your CSV files.\n",
       "\n",
       "Remember to replace the sample data with your own data, and you might need to install a solver like CBC, Gurobi, or CPLEX depending on the complexity of your problem.\n"

      "**Explanation:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Import Pyomo:**  `import pyomo.environ as pyo`\n",
      "2.  **Sample Data:** The code starts by defining sample data for the parameters. **Remember to replace this sample data with the actual data from your CSV files.**\n",
      "3.  **Create a Model:** A `ConcreteModel` is created to represent the optimization problem.\n",
      "4.  **Define Sets:** Sets for time periods (T), food products (F), and beverage products (B) are created using `pyo.Set`.\n",
      "5.  **Define Parameters:** The parameters from the problem are defined using `pyo.Param` and initialized with the sample data.\n",
      "6.  **Define Decision Variables:** Decision variables are defined using `pyo.Var` and are restricted to be non-negative using `domain=pyo.NonNegativeReals`.\n",
      "7.  **Define Objective Function:** The objective function, which is to maximize profit, is defined using `pyo.Objective`.\n",
      "8.  **Define Constraints:**  Each constraint from the mathematical model is implemented using `pyo.Constraint`.\n",
      "9.  **Solve the Model:** A solver ('cbc' in this case) is selected using `pyo.SolverFactory` and then used to solve the model.\n",
      "10. **Print Results:** The optimal profit and values of decision variables can be printed using the `print()` function and accessing the variable values using `.get_values()`.\n",
      "\n",
      "**To Use Your Data:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Install Pyomo:**  You can install Pyomo using `pip install pyomo`.\n",
      "2.  **Import Data from CSV:** You can use libraries like `pandas` to import data from your CSV files.\n",
      "3.  **Replace Sample Data:** Replace the sample data in the code with the data you imported from your CSV files.\n",
      "\n",
      "Remember to replace the sample data with your own data, and you might need to install a solver like CBC, Gurobi, or CPLEX depending on the complexity of your problem.\n",
