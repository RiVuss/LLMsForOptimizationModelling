It then creates a ConcreteModel object and adds the sets, decision variables, objective function, and constraints to the model. It tries to maximize the formulated objective function within the given constraints by using the GLPK solver. Lastly, it prints out the decision to invest or not in each investment strategy. The decision is a binary value - 1 if the investment is made and 0 otherwise."},"metadata":{},"execution_count":36}],"source":["Markdown(response2.choices[0].message.content)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### **Run the code Generated by GPT4**"],"metadata":{"id":"PkptoUVotWif"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["from pyomo.environ import *\n","\n","# Sample data\n","strategies = ['Strategy1', 'Strategy2', 'Strategy3', 'Strategy4', 'Strategy5']\n","scenarios = ['Scenario1', 'Scenario2']\n","\n","C = {'Strategy1': 3, 'Strategy2': 4, 'Strategy3': 5, 'Strategy4': 6, 'Strategy5': 7} # cost\n","R = {'Strategy1': 8, 'Strategy2': 9, 'Strategy3': 10, 'Strategy4': 11, 'Strategy5': 12} # return\n","V = {'Strategy1': 2, 'Strategy2': 3, 'Strategy3': 4, 'Strategy4': 1, 'Strategy5': 3} # variance\n","\n","B = {'Scenario1': 20, 'Scenario2': 15} # budget\n","P = {'Scenario1': 0.6, 'Scenario2': 0.4} # probabilities\n","T = 0.4 # tolerable probability\n","r = 2   # risk parameter\n","\n","m = ConcreteModel()\n","\n","# Sets\n","m.i = Set(initialize=strategies)\n","m.j = Set(initialize=scenarios)\n","\n","# Variables\n","m.x = Var(m.i, within=Binary)\n","\n","# Objective\n","m.OBJ = Objective(expr = sum(R[i]*m.x[i] -
