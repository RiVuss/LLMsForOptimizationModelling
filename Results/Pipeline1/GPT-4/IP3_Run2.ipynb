The sets `I` and `B` represent available items and boxes respectively.\n\nFor simplicity, I've assumed here that the maximum capacity of each box and the maximum number of boxes are constants. If these values differ per box, you'll need to make alterations to the model accordingly.\n\nThe objective function minimizes the number of boxes used, and the constraints enforce that each item is in exactly one box, the sum of the weights in each box doesn't exceed its capacity, and the total number of boxes used doesn't exceed `M`.\n\nFinally, we solve the model using the GLPK solver and print the decision variables' optimal values. \n\nNote: GLPK is one of the solver supported by Pyomo. If this solver is not available in your machine, you might need to install it or you can use a different solver that's supported by your platform."},"metadata":{},"execution_count":18}],"source":["Markdown(response2.choices[0].message.content)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### **Run the code Generated by GPT4**"],"metadata":{"id":"PkptoUVotWif"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Import Pyomo\n","from pyomo.environ import *\n","\n","# Data: this is where we fill in the actual data.\n","I = [1, 2, 3]       # Available items\n","B = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]  # Available boxes\n","W = {1:4, 2:2, 3:7}  # Weight of each item\n","C = 10               # The capacity of each box\n","M = 3                # Maximum number of boxes\n","\n","# Create a concrete model\n","model = ConcreteModel()\n","\n","# Decision variables\n","model.X = Var(((i,j) for i in I for j in B), within=Binary)\n","\n","# Objective function\n","model.obj = Objective(expr=sum(model.X[i,j] for i in I for j in B), sense=minimize)\n","\n","# Constraints\n","model.item_placement = ConstraintList()\n","for i in I:\n","    model.item_placement.add(sum(model.X[i,j] for j in B) == 1)\n","\n","model.box_capacity = ConstraintList()\n","for j in B:\n","    model.box_capacity.add(sum(W[i]*model.X[i,j] for i in I) <= C)\n","\n","model.box_limit = Constraint(expr=sum(model.X[i,j] for i in I for j in B) <= M )\n","\n","# Solve the model\n","solver = SolverFactory('glpk')\n","solver.solve(model)\n","\n","# Print the values of decision variables\n","for i in I:\n","    for j in B:\n","        print(f'X_{i}{j} = {value(model.X[i,j])}')"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"ormkwVDE-tjW","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1716645929332,"user_tz":-120,"elapsed":177,"user":{"displayName":"melis cevik","userId":"12474222781214144190"}},"outputId":"9c474b19-7fbe-4302-e4f7-a5dc284922f5"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["X_11 = 1.0\n","X_12 = 0.0\n","X_13 = 0.0\n","X_14 = 0.0\n","X_15 = 0.0\n","X_21 = 0.0\n","X_22 = 0.0\n","X_23 = 0.0\n","X_24 = 0.0\n","X_25 = 1.0\n","X_31 = 0.0\n","X_32 = 0.0\n","X_33 = 0.0\n","X_34 = 0.0\n","X_35 = 1.0\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Import Pyomo\n","from pyomo.environ import *\n","\n","# Data: inputted by human\n","I = list(range(1,25))     # Available items\n","B = list(range(1,16))  # Available boxes\n","W = {1: 2,2: 2,3: 2,4: 2,5: 3,6: 3,7:4,8: 4,9: 4,10: 4,11: 4,12:4,13: 5,14:5,15: 5,16: 5,17: 5,18: 5,19: 6,20:6,21: 7,22: 7,23: 8, 24:8} # Weight of each item\n","C = 9               # The capacity of each box\n","M = 15               # Maximum number of boxes\n","\n","# Create a concrete model\n","model = ConcreteModel()\n","\n","# Decision variables\n","model.X = Var(((i,j) for i in I for j in B), within=Binary)\n","\n","# Objective function\n","model.obj = Objective(expr=sum(model.X[i,j] for i in I for j in B), sense=minimize)\n","\n","# Constraints\n","model.item_placement = ConstraintList()\n","for i in I:\n","    model.item_placement.add(sum(model.X[i,j] for j in B) == 1)\n","\n","model.box_capacity = ConstraintList()\n","for j in B:\n","    model.box_capacity.add(sum(W[i]*model.X[i,j] for i in I) <= C)\n","\n","model.box_limit = Constraint(expr=sum(model.X[i,j] for i in I for j in B) <= M )\n","\n","# Solve the model\n","solver = SolverFactory('glpk')\n","solver.solve(model)\n","\n","# Print the values of decision variables\n"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1716646116704,"user_tz":-120,"elapsed":277,"user":{"displayName":"melis cevik","userId":"12474222781214144190"}},"outputId":"911788d9-47a6-435e-a940-4051dd146c35","id":"Ydkx2b-wFCcg"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["{'Problem': [{'Name': 'unknown', 'Lower bound': -inf, 'Upper bound': inf, 'Number of objectives': 1, 'Number of constraints': 40, 'Number of variables': 360, 'Number of nonzeros': 1080, 'Sense': 'minimize'}], 'Solver': [{'Status': 'ok', 'Termination condition': 'infeasible', 'Statistics': {'Branch and bound': {'Number of bounded subproblems': 0, 'Number of created subproblems': 0}}, 'Error rc': 0, 'Time': 0.007010221481323242}]}"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":61}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### **Edit and Run the code for the mathematical model produced by GPT4 (Circumstantial)**"],"metadata":{"id":"mQU-yLZJtbsc"}}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.9.7"},"colab":{"provenance":[]}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}
