The startup costs are 10324€, 5678€, 7802€, 12899€, 4596€ and 9076€ for powerplants 1 to 6, respectively. In addition, there is a constant shutdown cost for each power unit that is applied if the power plant is turned off. The shutdown costs are 2673€, 5893€, 982€, 6783€, 2596€ and 3561€ for powerplants 1 to 6, respectively. There is also a fixed and variable cost applied if the power plant is running. The fixed cost is constant and the variable cost is proportional to the output of a power plant. There are lower and upper bounds for the output power for each unit. The variable costs are different for each power plant and at each time step. Next, there are maximum power increments and decrements for each power plant that limit how much the output can change from one time period to the next. There is a total power demand that needs to be fulfilled by the power units. Finally, for security reasons, the total available power out should always be 10% higher than the demand. \"\"\""]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"LwViBw0ND7r0"},"outputs":[],"source":["client = openai.OpenAI(api_key=os.environ['api_key_env'])\n","\n","response1 = client.chat.completions.create(\n","    messages=[\n","        {\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"Please formulate a mathematical optimization model for this problem.
