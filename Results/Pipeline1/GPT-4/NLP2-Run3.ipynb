The mathematical functions like `log()`, and `pow()` could potentially result in math domain error depending upon the search direction of the solver (`x1` and `x2` might become 0). Therefore, one could adjust the initial values of `x1` and `x2` or reformulate the problem for better numerical behavior of the solver."},"metadata":{},"execution_count":8}],"source":["Markdown(response2.choices[0].message.content)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### **Run the code Generated by GPT4**"],"metadata":{"id":"PkptoUVotWif"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Install Python API for AMPL\n","!pip install amplpy --upgrade\n","\n","from amplpy import AMPL,ampl_notebook"],"metadata":{"id":"JexENGe3tcOt","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1717843213337,"user_tz":-120,"elapsed":17512,"user":{"displayName":"melis cevik","userId":"12474222781214144190"}},"outputId":"005855cf-3a81-4c9f-c13e-6f0da0cfd4eb"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Collecting amplpy\n","  Downloading amplpy-0.14.0-cp310-cp310-manylinux_2_17_x86_64.manylinux2014_x86_64.whl (5.6 MB)\n","\u001b[2K     \u001b[90m━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\u001b[0m \u001b[32m5.6/5.6 MB\u001b[0m \u001b[31m13.7 MB/s\u001b[0m eta \u001b[36m0:00:00\u001b[0m\n","\u001b[?25hCollecting ampltools>=0.7.5 (from amplpy)\n","  Downloading ampltools-0.7.5-py3-none-any.whl (18 kB)\n","Requirement already satisfied: requests in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from ampltools>=0.7.5->amplpy) (2.31.0)\n","Requirement already satisfied: charset-normalizer<4,>=2 in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from requests->ampltools>=0.7.5->amplpy) (3.3.2)\n","Requirement already satisfied: idna<4,>=2.5 in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from requests->ampltools>=0.7.5->amplpy) (3.7)\n","Requirement already satisfied: urllib3<3,>=1.21.1 in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from requests->ampltools>=0.7.5->amplpy) (2.0.7)\n","Requirement already satisfied: certifi>=2017.4.17 in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from requests->ampltools>=0.7.5->amplpy) (2024.6.2)\n","Installing collected packages: ampltools, amplpy\n","Successfully installed amplpy-0.14.0 ampltools-0.7.5\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["\n","_ = load_dotenv(find_dotenv('second_knitro_license.env'))\n","my_knitro_license = os.environ['knitro_license']\n","\n","ampl = ampl_notebook(\n","    modules=[\"knitro\"],  # modules to install\n","    license_uuid=my_knitro_license,  # license to use\n",")"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"HwLBVOOXPHP5","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1717843235943,"user_tz":-120,"elapsed":20226,"user":{"displayName":"melis cevik","userId":"12474222781214144190"}},"outputId":"5df14edf-9c11-4970-8fef-317e5c606f74","collapsed":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Licensed to AMPL Community Edition License for <cevikmelis14@gmail.com>.\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["from pyomo.environ import *\n","from math import log, pow\n","\n","# Creating a Concrete Model instance\n","model = ConcreteModel()\n","\n","# Defining the decision variables\n","model.x1 = Var(domain=NonNegativeReals)\n","model.x2 = Var(domain=NonNegativeReals)\n","\n","# Mean value\n","mean_value = (model.x1 + model.x2) / 2\n","\n","# Defining the objective function\n","model.profit = Objective(expr = log(model.x1 * model.x2) - pow((model.x1 + 2*model.x2), 1/3), sense=maximize)\n","\n","# Adding the constraints\n","model.Constraint1 = Constraint(expr = (model.x1 - mean_value)**2 <= 10)\n","model.Constraint2 = Constraint(expr = (model.x2 - mean_value)**2 <= 10)\n","model.Constraint3 = Constraint(expr = model.x1 + model.x2 <= 80)\n","\n","# Applying solver\n","solver = SolverFactory('ipopt')\n","result = solver.solve(model, tee=True)\n","\n","# Printing the optimal solutions\n","print(\"\\n The Optimal Solution is:\")\n","print('x1 = ', model.x1())\n","print('x2 = ', model.x2())\n","print('Profit = ', model.profit())"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":323},"id":"qaGmh38obw-t","executionInfo":{"status":"error","timestamp":1717843242530,"user_tz":-120,"elapsed":1138,"user":{"displayName":"melis cevik","userId":"12474222781214144190"}},"outputId":"b899cf6f-9e83-422f-c991-5f68e40268fe"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"error","ename":"TypeError","evalue":"Implicit conversion of Pyomo numeric value (x1*x2) to float is disabled.\nThis error is often the result of using Pyomo components as arguments to\none of the Python built-in math module functions when defining\nexpressions.
