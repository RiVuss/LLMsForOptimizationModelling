The fixed cost is constant and the variable cost is proportional to the output of a power plant. There are lower and upper bounds for the output power for each unit. The variable costs are different for each power plant and at each time step. Next, there are maximum power increments and decrements for each power plant that limit how much the output can change from one time period to the next. There is a total power demand that needs to be fulfilled by the power units. Finally, for security reasons, the total available power out should always be 10% higher than the demand. \"\"\""]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":6,"metadata":{"id":"LwViBw0ND7r0","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1717696912394,"user_tz":-120,"elapsed":37672,"user":{"displayName":"melis cevik","userId":"12474222781214144190"}}},"outputs":[],"source":["client = openai.OpenAI(api_key=os.environ['api_key_env'])\n","\n","response1 = client.chat.completions.create(\n","    messages=[\n","        {\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"Please formulate a mathematical optimization model for this problem.
