You are tasked with planning production for the next 12 time periods with the goal of maximizing profit. The production fascility is able to produce two types of food and three types of beverage. The food is produced in whole units, while the beverage can be produced in any fraction of a liter. For each product that is produced at period t, a fixed cost and variable cost incurred. Each product can also be stored which is also associated with a variable cost per product stored. There is also a maximum demand for each product and time period which means that a specific product will not be sold anymore if the demand is met for that time period. Please note, that the demand does not have to be met. The revenue per product and time also differs. The cost for production and storage, the demand and revenue are all provided as in sepearte csv files named \"fixed_cost_production.csv\", \"variable_cost_production.csv\", \"variable_cost_storage.csv\", \"demand.csv\" and \"revenue.csv\" where all files follow the structre of the columns representing time and rows representing product. Finally, there is a constant storage capacity and production capacity for each product that resets each time period.
