If you want to get the mean after solving the problem just call:\n\n```python\nmean = (model.l1.value + model.l2.value) / 2\nprint(\"Mean: \", mean)\n```\n\nIf you want to define the var `mean`, you should define it between the instantiation of `model = ConcreteModel()` and the constraints: \n\n```python\nmodel.mean = Var(domain=NonNegativeReals, initialize=0.5)\n```\n\nAnd in the constraints and objective function, replace `mean` with `model.mean`. \n\nAn initial guess for the decision variables `l1` and `l2` is given as `0.5` for the solver to start the process. This is a common practice in numerical optimization problems. \n\nRemember to install the `pyomo` and `ipopt` solver before running this script."},"metadata":{},"execution_count":9}],"source":["Markdown(response2.choices[0].message.content)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### **Run the code Generated by GPT4**"],"metadata":{"id":"PkptoUVotWif"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Install Python API for AMPL\n","!pip install amplpy --upgrade\n","\n","from amplpy import AMPL,ampl_notebook"],"metadata":{"id":"JexENGe3tcOt","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1717841963326,"user_tz":-120,"elapsed":10587,"user":{"displayName":"melis cevik","userId":"12474222781214144190"}},"outputId":"dab09942-6aed-42cd-b985-8f53e579e640"},"execution_count":11,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Collecting amplpy\n","  Downloading amplpy-0.14.0-cp310-cp310-manylinux_2_17_x86_64.manylinux2014_x86_64.whl (5.6 MB)\n","\u001b[2K     \u001b[90m━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\u001b[0m \u001b[32m5.6/5.6 MB\u001b[0m \u001b[31m16.2 MB/s\u001b[0m eta \u001b[36m0:00:00\u001b[0m\n","\u001b[?25hCollecting ampltools>=0.7.5 (from amplpy)\n","  Downloading ampltools-0.7.5-py3-none-any.whl (18 kB)\n","Requirement already satisfied: requests in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from ampltools>=0.7.5->amplpy) (2.31.0)\n","Requirement already satisfied: charset-normalizer<4,>=2 in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from requests->ampltools>=0.7.5->amplpy) (3.3.2)\n","Requirement already satisfied: idna<4,>=2.5 in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from requests->ampltools>=0.7.5->amplpy) (3.7)\n","Requirement already satisfied: urllib3<3,>=1.21.1 in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from requests->ampltools>=0.7.5->amplpy) (2.0.7)\n","Requirement already satisfied: certifi>=2017.4.17 in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from requests->ampltools>=0.7.5->amplpy) (2024.6.2)\n","Installing collected packages: ampltools, amplpy\n","Successfully installed amplpy-0.14.0 ampltools-0.7.5\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["\n","_ = load_dotenv(find_dotenv('second_knitro_license.env'))\n","my_knitro_license = os.environ['knitro_license']\n","\n","ampl = ampl_notebook(\n","    modules=[\"knitro\"],  # modules to install\n","    license_uuid=my_knitro_license,  # license to use\n",")"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"HwLBVOOXPHP5","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1717841985918,"user_tz":-120,"elapsed":21851,"user":{"displayName":"melis cevik","userId":"12474222781214144190"}},"outputId":"518c22a1-d3c3-4d42-d391-f1933b83818d","collapsed":true},"execution_count":12,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Licensed to AMPL Community Edition License for <cevikmelis14@gmail.com>.\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["from pyomo.environ import *\n","from math import log, pow\n","\n","# Instantiate our problem\n","model = ConcreteModel()\n","\n","# Pyomo has its log function and power function, but you can use the python math module if you want.\n","model.l1 = Var(domain=NonNegativeReals, initialize=0.5)\n","model.l2 = Var(domain=NonNegativeReals, initialize=0.5)\n","\n","obj_expr = log(model.l1 * model.l2) - pow(model.l1 + 2 * model.l2, 1.0/3.0)\n","model.Q = Objective(expr=obj_expr, sense=maximize)\n","\n","mean = (model.l1 + model.l2) / 2\n","model.con1 = Constraint(expr=(model.l1 - mean)**2 + (model.l2 - mean)**2 <= 10)\n","model.con2 = Constraint(expr=model.l1 + model.l2 <= 80)\n","\n","# Solver\n","solver = SolverFactory('ipopt')\n","solver.solve(model)\n","\n","print(\"Value of l1: \", model.l1())\n","print(\"Value of l2: \", model.l2())\n","print(\"Maximized Q: \", model.Q())"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":323},"id":"M79crAt5W8cd","executionInfo":{"status":"error","timestamp":1717841990622,"user_tz":-120,"elapsed":368,"user":{"displayName":"melis cevik","userId":"12474222781214144190"}},"outputId":"9843f2d5-c5d1-4598-9303-7d12f70128d1"},"execution_count":13,"outputs":[{"output_type":"error","ename":"TypeError","evalue":"Implicit conversion of Pyomo numeric value (l1*l2) to float is disabled.\nThis error is often the result of using Pyomo components as arguments to\none of the Python built-in math module functions when defining\nexpressions.
