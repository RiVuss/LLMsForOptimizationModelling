Alkalyte yield equals the amount of olefin feed multiplied by the sum of 1.12, 0.13167 times the external isobutane-to-olefin ratio and -0.00667 times the external isobutane-to-olefin ratio squared.\n","The motor octane number is derived from the external isobutane-to-olefin ratio and the acid strength. The motor octane number is calculated as the sum of 86.35, 1.098 time external isobutane-to-olefin ratio, -0.038 times the external isobutane-to-olefin ratio squared and 0.325 times acid strength reduced by 89.\n","The acid dilution factor is calculated based on the F-4 performance number. The acid dillution factor is expressed as 35.82 minus 0.222 times F-4 performance number.\n","Lastly, the F-4 performance number depends on the motor octane number. F-4 performance number is calculated as -133 plus three times the motor octane number.\n","\n","There are some additional constraints imposed by the nature of the chemical process.\n","Each variable has a lower and an upper bound.\n","The external isobutane-to-olefin ratio needs to equal the ratio of isobutane recycle plus isobutane makeup to olefin feed.\n","The acid strength needs to equal the ratio of 93000 times acid addition rate to acid addition rate multiplied by acid dilution factor in addition to 1000 times acid addition rate.\n","Lastly, 1.22 alkylate yield needs to be equal to the combined olefin feed and isobutane makeup.\"\"\"\n","\n","\n","client = MistralClient(api_key=API_KEY)\n","\n","print(f'Time of execution: {datetime.now()}')"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"3e540824","metadata":{"id":"3e540824"},"source":["## Step 1 - Generate Mathematical Formulation"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":4,"id":"174c127b","metadata":{"executionInfo":{"elapsed":5,"status":"ok","timestamp":1718377617171,"user":{"displayName":"Nathan Ferchtandiker","userId":"04497335229863873347"},"user_tz":-120},"id":"174c127b"},"outputs":[],"source":["messages_1 = [\n","    ChatMessage(role=\"system\", content=SYSTEM_PROMPT_1),\n","    ChatMessage(role=\"user\", content=PROBLEM_DESCRIPTION)\n","]"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":5,"id":"d43340f3","metadata":{"executionInfo":{"elapsed":21861,"status":"ok","timestamp":1718377639028,"user":{"displayName":"Nathan Ferchtandiker","userId":"04497335229863873347"},"user_tz":-120},"id":"d43340f3"},"outputs":[],"source":["response_1 = client.chat(\n","    model=MODEL_ID,\n","    messages=messages_1,\n","    random_seed=MODEL_SEED,\n","    temperature=MODEL_TEMPERATURE\n",")\n","\n","response_1_text = response_1.choices[0].message.content"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":6,"id":"03616e62","metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":1000},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":13,"status":"ok","timestamp":1718377639029,"user":{"displayName":"Nathan Ferchtandiker","userId":"04497335229863873347"},"user_tz":-120},"id":"03616e62","outputId":"47f16ccf-a772-45a2-ea51-d3c2ab871a31"},"outputs":[{"data":{"text/markdown":["To formulate a mathematical optimization model for this problem, we will define the parameters, decision variables, objective function, and constraints as follows:\n","\n","Parameters:\n","\n","* $C_{AF}$: Cost per barrel of olefin feed\n","* $C_{IR}$: Cost per barrel of isobutane recycle\n","* $C_{AAR}$: Cost per thousand pounds of acid addition rate\n","* $C_{IM}$: Cost per barrel of isobutane makeup\n","* $P_{AY}$: Price per barrel of alkylate yield\n","* $P_{MON}$: Price per unit of motor octane number\n","\n","Decision Variables:\n","\n","* $x_{1}$: Olefin feed (barrels per day)\n","* $x_{2}$: Isobutane recycle (barrels per day)\n","* $x_{3}$: Acid addition rate (thousands of pounds per day)\n","* $x_{4}$: Alkylate yield (barrels per day)\n","* $x_{5}$: Isobutane makeup (barrels per day)\n","* $x_{6}$: Acid strength (weight %)\n","* $x_{7}$: Motor octane number\n","* $x_{8}$: External isobutane-to-olefin ratio\n","* $x_{9}$: Acid dilution factor\n","* $x_{10}$: F-4 performance number\n","\n","Objective Function:\n","\n","The objective is to maximize the daily profit, which is defined as the revenue generated from the alkylate yield multiplied with the motor octane number, minus the operational costs.
