Once processed, each hectolitre of syrup produces 40 units of the 1.5 l COLI product and 20 units of the 1.5 l PEPSA product. If X1 units of the 1.5 l COLI product and X2 units of the 1.5 l PEPSA product are produced, the firm estimates that the daily income obtained in dollars would be given by the following function:\n","49000 times X1 minus X1 squared plus 30 times X2 minus two times X2 squared.\n","It costs 150 dollars to buy and process each hectolitre of syrup. The S1 packaging line has a net capacity of producing 7100 1.5 l product units every hour. The firm works 5 days a week in 8h shifts. Given its weekly target coverage, the firm is committed to produce at least half the amount of PEPSA than COLI. Although priority orders tend to amend its production planning, the firm wishes to have a basic product planning that optimises its daily profits.\"\"\"\n","\n","\n","client = MistralClient(api_key=API_KEY)\n","\n","print(f'Time of execution: {datetime.now()}')"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"3e540824","metadata":{"id":"3e540824"},"source":["## Step 1 - Generate Mathematical Formulation"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":4,"id":"174c127b","metadata":{"executionInfo":{"elapsed":6,"status":"ok","timestamp":1718370419322,"user":{"displayName":"Nathan Ferchtandiker","userId":"04497335229863873347"},"user_tz":-120},"id":"174c127b"},"outputs":[],"source":["messages_1 = [\n","    ChatMessage(role=\"system\", content=SYSTEM_PROMPT_1),\n","    ChatMessage(role=\"user\", content=PROBLEM_DESCRIPTION)\n","]"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":5,"id":"d43340f3","metadata":{"executionInfo":{"elapsed":13090,"status":"ok","timestamp":1718370432406,"user":{"displayName":"Nathan Ferchtandiker","userId":"04497335229863873347"},"user_tz":-120},"id":"d43340f3"},"outputs":[],"source":["response_1 = client.chat(\n","    model=MODEL_ID,\n","    messages=messages_1,\n","    random_seed=MODEL_SEED,\n","    temperature=MODEL_TEMPERATURE\n",")\n","\n","response_1_text = response_1.choices[0].message.content"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":6,"id":"03616e62","metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":966},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":10,"status":"ok","timestamp":1718370432407,"user":{"displayName":"Nathan Ferchtandiker","userId":"04497335229863873347"},"user_tz":-120},"id":"03616e62","outputId":"aae8691c-6409-4e96-a2db-8e6ac6ee093b"},"outputs":[{"data":{"text/markdown":["To formulate a mathematical optimization model for this problem, we will define the parameters, decision variables, objective function, and constraints as follows:\n","\n","Parameters:\n","- C1 = 49,000 (revenue coefficient for X1)\n","- C2 = 30 (revenue coefficient for X2)\n","- C3 = 150 (cost per hectolitre of syrup)\n","- H = 40 (number of 1.5 l COLI units produced per hectolitre of syrup)\n","- K = 20 (number of 1.5 l PEPSA units produced per hectolitre of syrup)\n","- P = 7,100 (net capacity of S1 production line in 1.5 l product units per hour)\n","- T = 40 (weekly working hours)\n","- W = 5 (number of working days per week)\n","\n","Decision variables:\n","- X1 (number of 1.5 l COLI units produced)\n","- X2 (number of 1.5 l PEPSA units produced)\n","\n","Objective function:\n","The objective is to maximize daily profit, which is given by the revenue from selling X1 and X2 units minus the cost of producing them.
