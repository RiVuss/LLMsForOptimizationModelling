Once processed, each hectolitre of syrup produces 40 units of the 1.5 l COLI product and 20 units of the 1.5 l PEPSA product. If X1 units of the 1.5 l COLI product and X2 units of the 1.5 l PEPSA product are produced, the firm estimates that the daily income obtained in dollars would be given by the following function:\n","49000 times X1 minus X1 squared plus 30 times X2 minus two times X2 squared.\n","It costs 150 dollars to buy and process each hectolitre of syrup. The S1 packaging line has a net capacity of producing 7100 1.5 l product units every hour. The firm works 5 days a week in 8h shifts. Given its weekly target coverage, the firm is committed to produce at least half the amount of PEPSA than COLI. Although priority orders tend to amend its production planning, the firm wishes to have a basic product planning that optimises its daily profits.\"\"\"\n","\n","\n","\n","client = MistralClient(api_key=API_KEY)\n","\n","print(f'Time of execution: {datetime.now()}')"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"3e540824","metadata":{"id":"3e540824"},"source":["## Step 1 - Generate Mathematical Formulation"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":5,"id":"174c127b","metadata":{"executionInfo":{"elapsed":5,"status":"ok","timestamp":1718370069024,"user":{"displayName":"Nathan Ferchtandiker","userId":"04497335229863873347"},"user_tz":-120},"id":"174c127b"},"outputs":[],"source":["messages_1 = [\n","    ChatMessage(role=\"system\", content=SYSTEM_PROMPT_1),\n","    ChatMessage(role=\"user\", content=PROBLEM_DESCRIPTION)\n","]"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":6,"id":"d43340f3","metadata":{"executionInfo":{"elapsed":6303,"status":"ok","timestamp":1718370075322,"user":{"displayName":"Nathan Ferchtandiker","userId":"04497335229863873347"},"user_tz":-120},"id":"d43340f3"},"outputs":[],"source":["response_1 = client.chat(\n","    model=MODEL_ID,\n","    messages=messages_1,\n","    random_seed=MODEL_SEED,\n","    temperature=MODEL_TEMPERATURE\n",")\n","\n","response_1_text = response_1.choices[0].message.content"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":7,"id":"03616e62","metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":618},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":11,"status":"ok","timestamp":1718370075323,"user":{"displayName":"Nathan Ferchtandiker","userId":"04497335229863873347"},"user_tz":-120},"id":"03616e62","outputId":"302e7a61-c330-436b-c651-9212f5dacaa2"},"outputs":[{"data":{"text/markdown":["Here is a mathematical optimization model for the problem:\n","\n","Parameters:\n","\n","* C1 = 49000 (coefficient for X1 in the revenue function)\n","* C2 = 30 (coefficient for X2 in the revenue function)\n","* P = 150 (cost of buying and processing each hectolitre of syrup)\n","* H = 40 (number of units of 1.5 l COLI product produced from each hectolitre of syrup)\n","* J = 20 (number of units of 1.5 l PEPSA product produced from each hectolitre of syrup)\n","* C = 7100 (net capacity of the S1 production line in 1.5 l product units per hour)\n","* S = 8 (number of hours in a work shift)\n","* T = 5 (number of days worked per week)\n","\n","Decision variables:\n","\n","* X1 (number of units of 1.5 l COLI product to produce)\n","* X2 (number of units of 1.5 l PEPSA product to produce)\n","\n","Objective function:\n","\n","Maximize profit, given by the revenue function minus the cost of syrup:\n","\n","Profit = C1 \\* X1 - X1^2 + C2 \\* X2 - 2 \\* X2^2 - P \\* (X1/H + X2/J)\n","\n","Constraints:\n","\n","1.
