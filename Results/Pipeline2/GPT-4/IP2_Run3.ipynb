If so, you may have to adjust these parameters or the investment strategies themselves. For real data, you would update the code to read the appropriate csv file into the 'M' matrix and to handle any other requirements of your specific problem."},"metadata":{},"execution_count":12}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### **Run the code Generated by GPT4**"],"metadata":{"id":"ezd3NejVbz9k"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["from numpy import mean, var\n","from pyomo.environ import *\n","\n","model = ConcreteModel()\n","\n","# Set dimensions\n","n = 10\n","m = 4\n","k = 10\n","\n","# Matrix for past investment outcomes for each strategy\n","M = [[5, 7, 9, 11, 4, 6, 8, 10, 3, 14]*10 for _ in range(n)]\n","\n","# Other sample data as described in the variables section\n","A_values = [80, 340, 410, 50, 180, 221, 15, 348, 191, 225]\n","P_values = [0.55, 0.4, 0.04, 0.01]\n","B_values = [1000, 1100, 900, 1200]\n","r_value = 2\n","T_value = 0.4\n","\n","# Define model variables and sets\n","model.investment_strategy = RangeSet(n)\n","model.budget_scenario = RangeSet(m)\n","model.X = Var(model.investment_strategy, model.budget_scenario, domain=Binary)\n","model.A = Param(model.investment_strategy, initialize=lambda model, i: A_values[i-1])\n","model.P = Param(model.budget_scenario, initialize=lambda model, j: P_values[j-1])\n","model.B = Param(model.budget_scenario, initialize=lambda model, j: B_values[j-1])\n","\n","# Objective function\n","model.obj = Objective(expr=sum(model.P[j]*sum(model.X[i,j]*(r_value*var(M[i-1]) -
