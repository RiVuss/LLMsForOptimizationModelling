      "Note: The variables \\( W \\), \\( C \\), and \\( S \\) represent the decision variables in this optimization problem. The farmer will decide the optimal values for these variables to minimize her total costs.\n",

      "\n",
      "The objective function is to minimize the total costs, which is the sum of fixed costs for planting each acre of each crop and the costs of purchasing wheat and corn to meet the demand.

      "4. The sugar beet production constraint:\n",
      "\\[ Y_s S \\leq Q \\]\n",
      "\n",
      "These constraints ensure that the farmer uses her available land optimally, meets the demand for wheat and corn for cattle feed, and does not exceed the sugar beet production quota imposed by the European Commission.\n",
      "\n",
      "Once the objective function and constraints have been defined, the optimization problem can be solved using linear programming techniques to find the optimal values for the decision variables \\( W \\), \\( C \\), and \\( S \\), which would minimize the total costs for the farmer.\n"
