If X1 units of the 1.5 l COLI product and X2 units of the 1.5 l PEPSA product are produced, the firm estimates that the daily income obtained in dollars would be given by the following function:\n","49000 times X1 minus X1 squared plus 30 times X2 minus two times X2 squared.\n","It costs 150 dollars to buy and process each hectolitre of syrup. The S1 packaging line has a net capacity of producing 7100 1.5 l product units every hour. The firm works 5 days a week in 8h shifts. Given its weekly target coverage, the firm is committed to produce at least half the amount of PEPSA than COLI. Although priority orders tend to amend its production planning, the firm wishes to have a basic product planning that optimises its daily profits.\"\"\"\n","\n","\n","client = MistralClient(api_key=API_KEY)\n","\n","print(f'Time of execution: {datetime.now()}')"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"3e540824","metadata":{"id":"3e540824"},"source":["## Step 1 - Generate Mathematical Formulation"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":12,"id":"174c127b","metadata":{"executionInfo":{"elapsed":3277,"status":"ok","timestamp":1718351946175,"user":{"displayName":"Nathan Ferchtandiker","userId":"04497335229863873347"},"user_tz":-120},"id":"174c127b"},"outputs":[],"source":["messages_1 = [\n","    ChatMessage(role=\"system\", content=SYSTEM_PROMPT_1),\n","    ChatMessage(role=\"user\", content=PROBLEM_DESCRIPTION),\n","    ChatMessage(role=\"user\", content=USER_PROMPT_1)\n","]\n","\n","response_1 = client.chat(\n","    model=MODEL_ID,\n","    messages=messages_1,\n","    random_seed=MODEL_SEED,\n","    temperature=MODEL_TEMPERATURE\n",")\n","\n","response_1_text = response_1.choices[0].message.content"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":13,"id":"03616e62","metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":267},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":12,"status":"ok","timestamp":1718351946176,"user":{"displayName":"Nathan Ferchtandiker","userId":"04497335229863873347"},"user_tz":-120},"id":"03616e62","outputId":"e57e2cd7-96e3-4813-da8e-acf97eb499bc"},"outputs":[{"data":{"text/markdown":["Step 1: Define parameters and variables\n","\n","Parameters:\n","- Cost of processing each hectolitre of syrup: $150 (denoted as C)\n","- Production capacity of S1 line per hour: 7100 units (denoted as P)\n","- Hours worked per day: 8 hours (denoted as H)\n","- Days worked per week: 5 days (denoted as D)\n","\n","Variables:\n","- Number of units of 1.5 l COLI product produced: X1 (decision variable)\n","- Number of units of 1.5 l PEPSA product produced: X2 (decision variable)\n","\n","Note: Since the problem mentions that the firm works 5 days a week in 8h shifts, the total production capacity per week is P \\* H \\* D.
