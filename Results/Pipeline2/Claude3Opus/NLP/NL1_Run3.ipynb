            " A firm that packs refreshments and beers, situated in the province of Valencia (Spain) employs the same syrup to produce its 1.5 l COLI and PEPSA products on its S1 production line. Once processed, each hectolitre of syrup produces 40 units of the 1.5 l COLI product and 20 units of the 1.5 l PEPSA product. If X1 units of the 1.5 l COLI product and X2 units of the 1.5 l PEPSA product are produced, the firm estimates that the daily income obtained in dollars would be given by the following function:\n",

The firm works 5 days a week in 8h shifts. Given its weekly target coverage, the firm is committed to produce at least half the amount of PEPSA than COLI. Although priority orders tend to amend its production planning, the firm wishes to have a basic product planning that optimises its daily profits. \n",

            "4. We define the objective function using `Objective()` and provide the expression for the daily profit. The `sense` parameter is set to `maximize` to indicate that we want to maximize the objective function.\n",
            "5. We define the constraints using `Constraint()`:\n",
            "   - The production capacity constraint: `X1 + X2 <= 56800`\n",
            "   - The minimum PEPSA production constraint: `X2 >= 0.5 * X1`\n",
            "   Note that the non-negativity constraints are already handled by specifying the domain of the decision variables as `NonNegativeReals`.\n",
            "6. We create an instance of the solver using `SolverFactory('ipopt')`. You can use any suitable solver available in Pyomo.\n",
            "7. We solve the optimization problem using `solver.solve(model)`.\n",
            "8. Finally, we print the optimal values of the decision variables `X1` and `X2`, as well as the optimal daily profit.\n",
            "\n",
            "Note: This code assumes that you have Pyomo and a suitable solver (e.g., IPOPT) installed in your Python environment.\n",
            "\n",
