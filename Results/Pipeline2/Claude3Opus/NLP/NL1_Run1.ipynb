            " A firm that packs refreshments and beers, situated in the province of Valencia (Spain) employs the same syrup to produce its 1.5 l COLI and PEPSA products on its S1 production line. Once processed, each hectolitre of syrup produces 40 units of the 1.5 l COLI product and 20 units of the 1.5 l PEPSA product. If X1 units of the 1.5 l COLI product and X2 units of the 1.5 l PEPSA product are produced, the firm estimates that the daily income obtained in dollars would be given by the following function:\n",
            "49000 times X1 minus X1 squared plus 30 times X2 minus two times X2 squared. \n",
            "It costs 150 dollars to buy and process each hectolitre of syrup. The S1 packaging line has a net capacity of producing 7100 1.5 l product units every hour. The firm works 5 days a week in 8h shifts. Given its weekly target coverage, the firm is committed to produce at least half the amount of PEPSA than COLI. Although priority orders tend to amend its production planning, the firm wishes to have a basic product planning that optimises its daily profits. \n",

            "3. We define the decision variables `X1` and `X2` using `Var()` and specify that they should be non-negative using `within=NonNegativeReals`.\n",
            "\n",
            "4. We define the objective function using `Objective()` and provide the expression for the daily profit. The `sense=maximize` argument indicates that we want to maximize the objective function.\n",
            "\n",
            "5. We define the constraints using `Constraint()`:\n",
            "   - The `syrup_constraint` ensures that the production of COLI and PEPSA does not exceed the available syrup capacity. We use sample data of 1000 hectolitres for `Syrup_Capacity`.\n",
            "   - The `production_constraint` ensures that the total production of COLI and PEPSA does not exceed the daily production capacity of 56800 units.\n",
            "   - The `pepsa_constraint` ensures that the production of PEPSA is at least half the amount of COLI.\n",
            "\n",
            "6. We create an instance of the solver using `SolverFactory('ipopt')` and solve the optimization problem using `solver.solve(model)`.\n",
            "\n",
            "7. Finally, we print the optimal solution values for `X1` and `X2` and the maximum daily profit.\n",
            "\n",
            "Note: We used sample data of 1000 hectolitres for `Syrup_Capacity`. You can replace this with the actual value if available.\n",
            "\n",
            "This code formulates the optimization problem using Pyomo, defines the decision variables, objective function, and constraints, and solves the problem using the IPOPT solver. The optimal solution and maximum daily profit are then printed.\n"
